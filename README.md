Profiling
=========

The profiling package is an interactive continuous Python profiler.  It is
inspired from [Unity 3D] profiler.  This package provides these features:

- Profiling statistics keep the frame stack.
- An interactive TUI profiling statistics viewer.
- Provides both of statistical and deterministic profiling.
- Utilities for remote profiling.
- Thread or greenlet aware CPU timer.
- Supports Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.
- Currently supports only Linux.

Installation
------------

Install the latest release via PyPI:

```sh
$ pip install profiling
```

Profiling
---------

To profile a single program, simply run the `profiling` command:

```sh
$ profiling your-program.py
```

Then an interactive viewer will be executed:

If your program uses greenlets, choose `greenlet` timer:

```sh
$ profiling --timer=greenlet your-program.py
```

With `--dump` option, it saves the profiling result to a file.  You can
browse the saved result by using the `view` subcommand:

```sh
$ profiling --dump=your-program.prf your-program.py
$ profiling view your-program.prf
```

If your script reads ``sys.argv``, append your arguments after ``--``.
It isolates your arguments from the ``profiling`` command:

```sh
$ profiling your-program.py -- --your-flag --your-param=42
```

Live Profiling
--------------

If your program has a long life time like a web server, a profiling result
at the end of program is not helpful enough.  Probably you need a continuous
profiler.  It can be achived by the `live-profile` subcommand:

```sh
$ profiling live-profile webserver.py
```

See a demo:

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/25394.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/25394)

There's a live-profiling server also.  The server doesn't profile the
program at ordinary times.  But when a client connects to the server, it
starts to profile and reports the results to the all connected clients.

Start a profling server by the `remote-profile` subcommand:

```sh
$ profiling remote-profile webserver.py --bind 127.0.0.1:8912
```

And also run a client for the server by the `view` subcommand:

```sh
$ profiling view 127.0.0.1:8912
```

Flamegraph integration
----------------------

Flame graphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most 
frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. [Read more](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph).

```bash
$ profiling --flamegraph=your-program.out your-program.py
$ flamegraph.pl your-program.out > your-program.svg
```

Statistical Profiling
---------------------

`TracingProfiler`, the default profiler, implements a deterministic profiler
for deep call graph.  Of course, it has heavy overhead.  The overhead can
pollute your profiling result or can make your application to be slow.

In contrast, `SamplingProfiler` implements a statistical profiler.  Like other
statistical profilers, it also has only very cheap overhead.  When you profile
you can choose it by just `--sampling` (shortly `-S`) option:

```sh
$ profiling live-profile -S webserver.py
                         ^^
```

Timeit then Profiling
---------------------

Do you use `timeit` to check the performance of your code?

```sh
$ python -m timeit -s 'from trueskill import *' 'rate_1vs1(Rating(), Rating())'
1000 loops, best of 3: 722 usec per loop
```

If you want to profile the checked code, simply use the `timeit` subcommand:

```sh
$ profiling timeit -s 'from trueskill import *' 'rate_1vs1(Rating(), Rating())'
  ^^^^^^^^^
```

Profiling from Code
-------------------

You can also profile your program by ``profiling.tracing.TracingProfiler`` or
``profiling.sampling.SamplingProfiler`` directly:

```python
from profiling.tracing import TracingProfiler

# profile your program.
profiler = TracingProfiler()
profiler.start()
...  # run your program.
profiler.stop()

# or using context manager.
with profiler:
    ...  # run your program.

# view and interact with the result.
profiler.run_viewer()
# or save profile data to file
profiler.dump('path/to/file')
# and save to flamegraph format
profiler.save_as_flamegraph('path/to/file')

```

Columns
-------

### Common

- `FUNCTION`
  1. The function name with the code location.
     (e.g. `my_func (my_code.py:42)`, `my_func (my_module:42)`)
  1. Only the location without line number.  (e.g. `my_code.py`, `my_module`)

### Tracing Profiler

- `CALLS` - Total call count of the function.
- `OWN` (Exclusive Time) - Total spent time in the function excluding sub
                           calls.
- `/CALL` after `OWN` - Exclusive time per call.
- `%` after `OWN` - Exclusive time per total spent time.
- `DEEP` (Inclusive Time) - Total spent time in the function.
- `/CALL` after `DEEP` - Inclusive time per call.
- `%` after `DEEP` - Inclusive time per total spent time.

### Sampling Profiler

- `OWN` (Exclusive Samples) - Number of samples which are collected during the
                              direct execution of the function.
- `%` after `OWN` - Exclusive samples per number of the total samples.
- `DEEP` (Inclusive Samples) - Number of samples which are collected during the
                               excution of the function.
- `%` after `DEEP` - Inclusive samples per number of the total samples.

Testing
-------

There are some additional requirements to run the test code, which can be
installed by running the following command.

```sh
$ pip install $(python test/fit_requirements.py test/requirements.txt)
```

Then you should be able to run `pytest`.

```sh
$ pytest -v
```
